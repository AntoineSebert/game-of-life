## Motivation

This project is an entry to the [Local Hack Day 2018](https://localhackday.mlh.io/). It aims to implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) inside Conway's Game of Life while giving zero fucks, or even a negative amount of fucks.

## Technical choices

* configuration files : toml
* documents format : Markdown
* Rust
* CLI (no GUI)

## Getting Started

make ... ?
run dandelion
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
rustc
cargo

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### End to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why.

```
cargo test
```

### Coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why.
